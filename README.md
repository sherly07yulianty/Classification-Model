# Classification-Model

Hello, welcome to my repository!ðŸ‘‹

This project compares three classification methodsâ€”K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Treeâ€”for diabetes prediction. Using features such as Pregnancies, Glucose, Insulin, BMI, and Age, the study evaluates each model based on accuracy and computation time, with and without Min-Max normalization. Results show that Min-Max normalization improves KNN performance, while Decision Tree performs best without normalization.
